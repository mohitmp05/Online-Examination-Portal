            <br><h2>OUR JOURNEY</h2><br>
            <P>A journey that started due to pandemic has paved a path for innovation. Moin one day called me (Shubham) and shared a thought of making a website. I and Moin always discussed buzzing start-ups and business ideas. From our first years we had a dream to start a company. We wanted to be part of the process that makes buddies a team and a scratch into a company. Maybe this was a result of Wolf of Wall Street or Pitchers that we binge watched every weekend.There was a third wheel as well in the team, Sonu. We three together started this beautiful journey. Our vision was very clear regarding the product, service and niche. We initially started a website that helped students in choosing their career and college. It was a college directory having a collection of colleges of all streams. This gave us an exposure of the market and mindset of students. We even launched our first study material for JEE aspirants. It was a unique concept that had a 30 day time table covering the entire syllabus with test papers. After this we even worked as counseling experts for JEE and NEET aspirants. While exploring these new ventures we realised that we need few more brains to handle the increasing loads. Who would be better than friends. We then added two of our closest friends, Arsh and Rahul, who had the perfect skill sets that we needed. Five classmates together were ready to explore and build a company of its kind.</P><br>
